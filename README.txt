Say hello to Story, a brand new responsive one-pager for HTML5 UP! Inspired by my work
on Carrd*, Story is built to be extremely modular and tweakable, and as such is entirely
built on reusable, insanely customizable elements (like "spotlight" and "gallery") that
can be endlessly duplicated and tweaked into whatever you need to tell your story --
without, in many cases, touching *any* CSS. Check out index-demo.html for an interactive
demo, and index.html for the actual template. Enjoy!

(* = my other side project -- carrd.co)
